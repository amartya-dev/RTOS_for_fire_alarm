# RTOS for Fire Alarm

Uncontrolled fires are responsible for many harmful damages and human losses. Hence, the design of a system in order to reduce such problems may be considered relevant. 

The use of real-time operating systems can present a possibility to achieve significant results and improvements in fire alarm projects, considering that fires are examples of critical time systems in which the time of response is extremely important. 

In the proposed project, an algorithm is developed by using Arduino Uno and FreeRTOS open source kernel in order to accomplish such task in a reduced scale project.

A system is said to be Real Time if it is required to complete its work & deliver its services on time. The use of real-time operating systems can present a possibility to achieve significant results and improvements in fire alarm projects, considering that fires are examples of critical time systems in which the time of response is extremely important.

# Hardware Setup

# Steps to Run:

1. Setup the hardware by connecting arduino uno with the flame sensor
2. Install Arduino Ide https://www.arduino.cc
